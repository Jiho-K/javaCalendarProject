# javaCalendarProject
Calendar created in java. The code is not fully developed by myself (Only the basic file which opens and displays a blank page on different OS was provided). For more details, feel free to contact me at jihok1107@gmail.com

To open the program, I recommend using Netbeans IDE for Java and importing the program as a zip.
